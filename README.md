PUC Java Game

Simple game published as a browser applet made with Java 1.0 in 1996. Weighting only 5 kbytes (without images) this game was featured in puc.com.br, a website from a brand of Hering, Brazilian clothing business @HeringOficial and stayed there for months.

Wanna play? In Netscape Communicator 4.79 it works.

I lost the original source but figured out a draft rebuiding, made available here.
